Notice: 
-------

In this project (in the source code, in sample files, README files etc.)
you will find some information about taxes, tax classes, taxation, product 
pricing etc.

All those information are just examples, they could simply be wrong, not suit 
your individual situation, be different in your country or area, or change over
time.

Do not rely on those information when setting up the software for production 
use, or for any other purpose - always ask a certified tax consultant!

We do not take any responsibility or liability if you get in trouble with your
local tax office or loose money because you pay more VAT to the tax office than
you actually need!

Also, take into consideration that this software does not have any official 
certification. Hence it is very likely that you cannot use it as a replacement 
for a real certified electronic cash register which meets all criteria defined
by the law in the country (and time) you life in. If you want to use this software
in a shop, make sure you contact a lawyer and/or a tax consultant and/or the 
authorities in order to find out if it is possible or not.

Again - you are using this at your own risk, and we do not take any responsibility 
or liability in case you get in trouble with the local authorities!
