Notice: 
-------

In this project (in the source code, in sample files, README files etc.)
you will find some information about taxes, tax classes, taxation, product 
pricing etc.

All those information are just examples, they could simply be wrong, not suit 
your individual situation, be different in your country or area, or change over
time.

Do not rely on those information when setting up the software for production 
use, or for any other purpose - always ask a certified tax consultant!

We do not take any responsibility or liability if you get in trouble with your
local tax office or loose money because you pay more VAT to the tax office than
you actually need!
